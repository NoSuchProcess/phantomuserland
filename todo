 - check that restart list is killed and all contained in 1-link objects too.

 - win/tty restarts/reconnects incorrectly - window does not get focus

 - win reconnect - must take z order in account - insert in list at the
   right place.

 - phantom disk format utility must use same superblock checksum/format code 
   as kernel.

 - BUG - need to reimplement snap sync code or else blocking syscalls
   will prevent snap from being done.
